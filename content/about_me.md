I am an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of Notre Dame, graduating in 2022. When I am not in class or doing homework you can most likely find me at [water polo](http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/) practice, reading, or writing. I am a very dedicated, hardworking individual and am always eager to learn new things.
