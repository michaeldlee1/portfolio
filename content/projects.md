## Overview
This is where I will keep track of my completed projects (in reverse chronological order), with broad explanations of their development process as well as links to their respective git repositories.

### "Spidey" Web Server 
* Gitlab: [cse-20289-sp20-project](https://gitlab.com/patrick_harkins/cse-20289-sp20-project) (private repository)

* This was the final project for my Systems Programming course in the Spring of 2020. The project entailed the creation of a functional web server (called spidey) writtten in C which can handle multiple requests at atime and perform file directory, and cgi requests. This was a group project and I collaborated with my partner, Patrick Harkins. Broadly, I was in charge of writing the majority of the code implementing the server functionality (with his assistance) while he took the lead in writing scripts to test the site's efficiency as well as putting together a presentation for our professor. Unfortunately for academic honor code reasons, this repo had to be private.
