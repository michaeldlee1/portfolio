      <description>Overview This is where I will keep track of my completed projects (in reverse chronological order), with broad explanations of their development process as well as links to their respective git repositories.
&amp;ldquo;Spidey&amp;rdquo; Web Server   Gitlab: cse-20289-sp20-project (private repository)
  This was the final project for my Systems Programming course in the Spring of 2020. The project entailed the creation of a functional web server (called spidey) writtten in C which can handle multiple requests at atime and perform file directory, and cgi requests.</description>

      <description>I am an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of Notre Dame, graduating in 2022. When I am not in class or doing homework you can most likely find me at water polo practice, reading, or writing. I am a very dedicated, hardworking individual and am always eager to learn new things.
